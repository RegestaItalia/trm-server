# trm-server Setup

**trm-server** is the server-side component of TRM.

It acts as the secure bridge between the **SAP application server** and the **TRM client**, exposing the RFC-enabled APIs required to manage transport operations.

It exposes the APIs that allow TRM to import/export transports, and, as a consequence, it must be installed **only** on source and target systems, as its not required on any other system in the landscape.

## First Installation

The first installation must be performed using [abapGit](https://abapgit.org/).

If you have not installed it yet, follow the official guide:\
https://docs.abapgit.org/user-guide/getting-started/install.html

The minimum required installation is the **Standalone Version**:\
https://docs.abapgit.org/user-guide/getting-started/install.html#install-standalone-version

Once abapGit is installed, you can install `trm-server` either as an **online** or **offline** repository.

## Online Repository Installation

1.  Run **abapGit** (standalone or developer version)

2.  On the repository list page, select **"New Online"**

3.  Enter the repository URL:

    `https://github.com/RegestaItalia/trm-server`

4.  Enter package name:

    `$TRM`

5.  Select **"Clone Online Repo"**

6.  Select **"Pull"**

## Offline Repository Installation

### Download Source Code

Download the latest release source code:

-   Direct link:\
    https://github.com/RegestaItalia/trm-server/archive/refs/heads/main.zip

OR

-   Open the GitHub repository page:\
    https://github.com/RegestaItalia/trm-server
    1.  Click **"\<\> Code"**\
    2.  Click **"Download ZIP"**

Save the ZIP file locally (usually named `trm-server-main.zip`).

### Import Using abapGit

1.  Run **abapGit**
2.  On the repository list page, select **"New Offline"**
3.  Enter:
    -   Repository name: `trm-server`
    -   Package name: `$TRM`
4.  Select **"Create Offline Repo"**
5.  Select **"Import ZIP"**
6.  Select the file `trm-server-main.zip`
7.  Select **"Pull ZIP"**

## User Authorization Maintenance

This package exposes **RFC-enabled function modules**.

For security reasons, all users are **not authorized by default** to execute most RFC functions.

Before using `trm-server`, authorized users must be maintained.

### Maintain Authorized Users

1.  Execute transaction `SE16`
2.  Create a new record in table `ZTRM_USERS`

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RegestaItalia/trm-server/main/docs/images/se16_1.png" alt="SE16">
</p>

After adding the user, press **SAVE**.

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RegestaItalia/trm-server/main/docs/images/se16_2.png" alt="SE16">
</p>

> For security reasons, by default, TRM does not allow any user to execute RFC functions unless explicitly authorized.

## Update

With `trm-server` already installed, there are two ways to keep it up to date.

### Using TRM Client

Run:

`trm update trm-server`

### Using abapGit

-   **Online repository** → Pull from branch `main`
-   **Offline repository** → Download latest `main` ZIP from GitHub and
    import again

## Package Consistency Check

1.  Open transaction `SE80`

2.  Open package `ZTRM`

3.  Right-click the root package

4.  Select:

    `Check → Package Check → Package Objects (Including Subpackages)`

The check should not return any errors.

### Verify RFC Authorization

To verify that a user has access to RFC functions:

1.  Log into the system as the user you want to test
2.  Execute function module `ZTRM_PING`

If the user is authorized, no errors should occur. If not authorized,
access will be denied.
